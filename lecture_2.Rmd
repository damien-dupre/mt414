# Creating a Website

.pull-left[
In the past, to create a website developers were coding in html files and adding style, colour and designs with css files.

This is not necessary anymore and not desirable either in the case of Data Analytics websites. Of course there are Wordpress websites but Data Analytics people don't do that.

.pull-right[
```{r out.width='100%'}
include_graphics("https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:893:470/g:fp:0.72:0.2/1*6nJz7yIwuADoEvGtio6kLg.png")
```
]

Data Analytics websites include both text, code and the output of the code, see for example:

- From fast.ai: https://nbdev.fast.ai
- Real World Data Science: https://realworlddatascience.net
- Salman Naqvi's personal website: https://forbo7.github.io
- Python pour la data science: https://pythonds.linogaliana.fr
- My own personal website: https://damien-datasci-blog.netlify.app

All are using the same technology called Quarto!

# What is Quarto?

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that builds on standard markdown with features essential for scientific communication.

- Computations: Python, R, Julia, Observable JS
- Markdown: Pandoc flavored markdown with many enhancements
- Output: Documents, presentations, websites, books, blogs

See https://quarto.org for more details

--

The Goal is to create a document that is all-in-one

- Documents that include source code for their production
- Notebook AND plain-text flavors
- Programmatic automation and reproducibility

--

And it has a template for websites, see tutorial here: https://adtarie.net/posts/007-quarto-python-tutorial/

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and 
executable code into a finished document. To learn 
more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document 
will be generated that includes both content and 
the output of embedded code. You can embed code 
like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of 
code (only output is displayed).

# Quarto Structure

Quarto files have 3 different types of content:

#### 1. The YAML

Displayed between two series of `---` signs, it corresponds to the metadata shown in the header of the output file (e.g., title, author, date, ...) and the type of output (e.g., pdf, html, doc, ...)

#### 2. The Text

Written in Markdown style (i.e., text without formatting), it is used as core description in the output document

#### 3. The Code

Inserted in the Quarto inside "chunks", the code is processed when creating the output and can display figures and tables

```{r out.width='100%'}

```

---
class: inverse, mline, center, middle

# 1. The YAML

---

# Output HTML

### Simple

```
---
format: html
---
```

--

### Default

```
---
title: "My First Quarto Document"
format: html
date: "99/99/9999"
---
```

--

### Elaborated

```
---
title: "My First Quarto Document"
subtitle: "My Subtitle"
author: "Damien Dupre"
date: "99/99/9999"
format: html
---
```

---

# Execute Python Code

Quarto can use R or Python to execute code:

- Python code is executed natively with the `python3` engine

```yaml
---
engine: python3
---
```

- Quarto can _also_ use the `jupyter` engine to execute Julia, Python, or other languages that Jupyter supports

```yaml
---
engine: jupyter
---
```

---

# Execute Code

Quarto also introduces some of these as options for `execute:` in YAML, for similar concepts in other languages.

```yaml
---
format: html
execute:
  echo: false
  warning: false
  message: false
---
```

---
class: inverse, mline, center, middle

# 2. Markdown Style ... you already know that!

# 3. The Python Code Chunks 

---

# Anatomy of a Code Chunk

````markdown
`r ''````{py}
#| label: gapminder-pop
#| echo: false
print('Hello, world!')
```
```` 

- Has 3x backticks on each end ` ``` ` 
- Place engine (`py`) between curly braces `{py}`  
- Place options underneath, behind the `#|` (hashpipe): `#| option1: value`  

---

# First Code Chunk

In the first code chunk, will be added all the __actions that will be applied to the following chunks__ (e.g., code option, library used, data downloaded, ...).

````markdown
`r ''````{py}
#| label: setup
#| include: false

# libraries
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px  
# code
mydataset = {
  'cars': ["BMW", "Volvo", "Ford"],
  'passings': [3, 7, 2]
}
myvar = pd.DataFrame(mydataset)
print(myvar)
fig = px.scatter(x=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], y=[0, 1, 4, 9, 16])
fig.show()
```

````

---

# Code Chunk Options

Chunk output can be customized with hashpipe options (i.e., arguments set after the `#|`). Above, we use 1 argument:

- `#| include: false` prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. Quarto still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.

Additional options can be turned on only for one chunk:

- `#| echo: true` will display the code and the results in the finished file (it overwrite `echo: false` set in the YAML for this chunk only)

See the **[Quarto Reference Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html)** for a complete list of chunk options.

---

# Figures in the Output Document

As long as the data frame object created in the first setup chunk, then a __visualisation can be used in a separated chunk__:

.small[
````markdown
---
title: "Untitled"
output: html
execute:
  echo: false
  warning: false
  message: false
---

`r ''````{py}
# libraries
import plotly.express as px  
# code
fig = px.scatter(x=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], y=[0, 1, 4, 9, 16])
```

# My Section Title

My text followed by my figure.

`r ''````{py}
fig.show()
```
````
]

---

# Visualisation Specific Options

Some chunk options are specific to visualisations outputs:

- fig-cap: "caption of the figure"
- fig-height: 5
- fig-width: 5

Note, the default unit for height and width is inches.

````markdown
`r ''````{py}
#| fig-cap: "caption of the figure"
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-width: 5

fig.show()
```
