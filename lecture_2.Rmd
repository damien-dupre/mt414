# Creating a Website

.pull-left[
In the past, to create a website developers were coding in html files and adding style, colour and designs with css files.

This is not necessary anymore and not desirable either in the case of Data Analytics websites. Of course there are Wordpress websites but Data Analytics people don't do that.
]

.pull-right[
```{r out.width='100%'}
include_graphics("https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:893:470/g:fp:0.72:0.2/1*6nJz7yIwuADoEvGtio6kLg.png")
```
]

Data Analytics websites include both text, code and the output of the code, see for example:

- From fast.ai: https://nbdev.fast.ai
- Real World Data Science: https://realworlddatascience.net
- Salman Naqvi's personal website: https://forbo7.github.io
- Python pour la data science: https://pythonds.linogaliana.fr
- My own personal website: https://damien-datasci-blog.netlify.app

All are using the same technology called Quarto!


---

# What is Quarto?

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that builds on standard markdown with features essential for scientific communication.

- Computations: Python, R, Julia, Observable JS
- Markdown: Pandoc flavoured markdown with many enhancements
- Output: Documents, presentations, websites, books, blogs

See https://quarto.org for more details

--

The Goal is to create a document that is all-in-one

- Documents that include source code for their production
- Notebook AND plain-text flavours
- Programmatic automation and reproducibility

--

And it has a template for websites, see tutorial here: https://adtarie.net/posts/007-quarto-python-tutorial/

## Your turn!

1/ Download and install the quarto version you need from here: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/
- Ubuntu 18+/Debian 10+	
- Linux Arm64	
- Mac OS	
- Windows

2/ Open a terminal window and type `quarto check`. In the output, you should see the following lines:

```markdown
[✓] Checking Python 3 installation....OK

[✓] Checking Jupyter engine render....OK
```
If not, let me know!

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 5, warn_when = 60)
```

# Quarto Structure

Quarto files have 3 different types of content:

#### 1. The YAML

In a cell of type "Raw", displayed between two series of `---` signs, it corresponds to the metadata shown in the header of the output file (e.g., title, author, date, ...) and the type of output (e.g., pdf, html, doc, ...)

#### 2. The Text

Written in Markdown style (i.e., text without formatting), it is used as core description in the output document

#### 3. The Code

Inserted in the Quarto inside code cells, the code is processed when creating the output and can display figures and tables

# Execute Python Code

Quarto can use R or Python to execute code

- Python code is executed natively with the `python3` engine

```yaml
---
engine: python3
---
```

- Quarto can _also_ use the `jupyter` engine to execute Julia, Python, or other languages that Jupyter supports

```yaml
---
jupyter: python3
---
```

---
class: inverse, mline, center, middle

# 2. Markdown Style ... you already know that!

---

class: inverse, mline, center, middle

# 3. The Python Code Cells 

---

# Anatomy of a Code Cell

```markdown
#| label: hello-world
#| echo: false
print('Hello, world!')
```

Place options underneath, behind the `#|` (hashpipe): `#| option1: value`  

Cells output can be customized with this hashpipe options (i.e., arguments set after the `#|`). Above, we use 1 argument:

See the **[Quarto Reference Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html)** for a complete list of chunk options.

---

# Figures in the Output Document

As long as the data frame object created in the first setup chunk, then a __visualisation can be used in a separated cell__:

.small[
```yaml
---
title: "Untitled"
format: html
jupyter: python3
---
```
```markdown
# libraries
import plotly.express as px  
# code
fig = px.scatter(x=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], y=[0, 1, 4, 9, 16])
```
```
# My Section Title

My text followed by my figure.
```

```markdown
fig.show()
```

]

---

# Visualisation Specific Options

Some cell options are specific to visualisations outputs:

- fig-cap: "caption of the figure"
- fig-height: 5
- fig-width: 5

Note, the default unit for height and width is inches.

```markdown
#| fig-cap: "caption of the figure"
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-width: 5

fig.show()
```

---

# Quarto platforms

Quarto can be used with any platform.

A tutorial is offered for the following ones at https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello:

.center[
```{r out.width='80%'}
include_img("quarto_platform.png")
```
]

But, once again, because it's the most common, we will see how to use it with jupyter.

.center[
```{r out.width='40%'}
include_graphics("https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/reproducible-reports-jupyter-quarto-python/graphics/featured-high-res.png")
```
]

## Your turn!

1/ Download the file `hello.ipynb` 
- from here: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/jupyter.html
- or by clicking here: <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/_hello.ipynb" download="hello.ipynb" data-original-href="https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/_hello.ipynb">Download hello.ipynb</a>

2/ Open Jupyter Lab and drop the `hello.ipynb` in the list of files in Jupyter (left pane)

3/ Open a new Terminal window (on Jupyter Lab or on your OS) and run the following instructions:

```markdown
quarto render hello.ipynb --to html
```

and then:

```markdown
open hello.html
```

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 5, warn_when = 60)
```

# 2. Create a website with Markdown and Python Code embedded

---

# Quarto Websites

Quarto Websites are a convenient way to publish groups of documents. Documents published as part of a website share navigational elements, rendering options, and visual style.

Website navigation can be provided through a global navbar, a sidebar with links, or a combination of both for sites that have multiple levels of content. You can also enable full text search for websites.

```{r}
include_graphics("https://www.paulbarrs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/painful.jpg")
```

---
class: title-slide, middle

## Your turn!

1/ Open a new Terminal window (on Jupyter Lab or on your OS) and run the following instructions:

```markdown
quarto create project website mysite
```

and then:

```markdown
quarto preview mysite
```

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 2, warn_when = 60)
```

---

# Quarto Websites

```markdown
quarto create project website mysite
```

Creates a new website project from the Terminal. This website project is initiated by a folder called `mysite` located on the root of your terminal.

--

The folder contains only 4 files:
- `_quarto.yml` is a yaml file, it design the overall style and the navbar
- `index.qmd` is a quarto file, it corresponds to the homepage
- `about.qmd` is another quarto file which is displayed when about is clicked on the navbar
- `styles.css` is for additional style not defined in `_quarto.yml`

--

Improve your Website:

- Navigation instructions here: https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html
- Option instructions here: https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/websites.html

---

# Quarto Websites

```markdown
quarto preview mysite
```

This command is used to render the website by converting all the `.qmd` files to `.html` files stored in a `_site` folder. 

The website preview will open in a new web browser. As you edit and save `index.qmd` (or other files like `about.qmd`) the preview is automatically updated.

```{r}
include_graphics("https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/media/rendered_site.png")
```

---

# qmd Files

Unfortunately `.ipynb` files cannot be used to build a website. 

Thankfully they can be converted to `.qmd` format by quarto with the instruction: 

```markdown
quarto convert myfile.ipynb
```
--

`.qmd` files are actually very similar to `.ipynb` files and are tailored for quarto:
- They have a yaml displayed between two series of `---` signs
- They have markdown text
- They can have code cell, also called chunks

--

Chunks are delimited by 3 backticks on each end ` ``` ` followed by the engine (`python`) between curly braces `{python}`  

````markdown
`r ''````{python}
print('Hello, world!')
```
```` 

---
class: title-slide, middle

## Your turn!

.pull-left[
1/ Open a new Terminal window (on Jupyter Lab or on your OS) and run the following instructions:

```markdown
quarto convert hello.ipynb
```

2/ Drag and drop the file `hello.qmd` created in the root of the `mysite` folder
]

.pull-right[
3/ Open the file `_quarto.yml` in Jupyter and modify it as follow:

```markdown
website:
  title: "Mysite"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd
      - hello.qmd
```

4/ In the same Terminal window, run the following instructions:

```markdown
quarto preview mysite
```
]

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 10, warn_when = 60)
```

# 3. Publish this website on GitHub

---

# Overview

There are three ways to publish Quarto websites and documents to GitHub Pages:

- **Render sites on your local machine to the docs directory**, check the rendered site into GitHub, and then configure your GitHub repo to publish from the docs directory.

- **Use the quarto publish command** to publish content rendered on your local machine.

- **Use a GitHub Action** to automatically render your files (a single Quarto document or a Quarto project) and publish the resulting content whenever you push a source code change to your repository.

The simplest way to publish using GitHub Pages is to render to the docs directory and then check that directory into your repository.

---

# Requirements

To publish using GitHub Pages with this easy way, there are 4 requirements:

.pull-left[
1/ **Change the output directory folder** to a folder named `docs` in the `_quarto.yml` file:

```markdown
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
```

Then preview or render the website

```markdown
quarto render mysite
```

2/ **Upload and commit all the files contained in the website folder** on your GitHub repository, not the website folder itself.
]

--

.pull-right[
3/ **Upload and commit a nojekyll file** that tells GitHub to not run its default html website processing

You can download this `nojekyll` file here:

```{r}
downloadthis::download_file(
  path = here::here("nojekyll"),
  output_name = "nojekyll",
  button_label = "Click here to download nojekyll",
  has_icon = TRUE,
  icon = "fa fa-save",
  self_contained = FALSE
)
```

4/ Then in **GitHub**, click **Settings** -> **Pages** choose:
- `main` branch
- `/docs` folder
- and Save
]

# Bonus Slides: Customise your Website

---

# Customise the URL

By default, the URL of your website will be: https://github-username.github.io/repository-name

However if your repository is called `github-username.github.io`, your URL will be: https://github-username.github.io

See for example:
- https://github.com/damien-dupre/damien-dupre.github.io
- https://damien-dupre.github.io/

---

# Customise the URL

You can also buy a domain name with www.godaddy.com or competitors. 
- In **GitHub**, click **Settings** -> **Pages** and fill your custom domain.
- Add a file called CNAME in your repository with the domain name (e.g., https://github.com/garymckeown/ISRE24/blob/main/CNAME)
- In the `_quarto.yml` file, add `site-url` and `resources`, for example:

```markdown
website:
  title: "Conference of the International Society for Research on Emotion"
  site-url: https://isre2024.org
  
resources:
  - CNAME
```

See https://github.com/garymckeown/ISRE24/blob/main/_quarto.yml

---

# Customise the Design

Quarto includes 25 different themes, see list here: https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html

Use of any of these themes via the `theme` option in the `_quarto.yml` file

```markdown
format:
  html:
    theme: united
```

--

There are a set of options you can provide in document metadata to customize its appearance such as `max-width`, `mainfont`, `fontsize`, `fontcolor` or `backgroundcolor`.

---

# Customise the Pages

1. Look at the gallery of quarto websites: https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/#websites

2. Find a page that you like and find it in GitHub, for example:
- https://www.mm218.dev/
- https://github.com/mikemahoney218/mm218.dev/blob/main/index.qmd

3. Adapt the code to your own website.
