# 1. Create a html pages from your notebooks

# Rendering notebooks

Code files (like .py or .r) only contain code plus comments introduced by #

Notebook files (like .ipynb, .Rmd, or .qmd) can contain both text and code.

Rendering a notebook, is the activity of creating a shareable report from your notebook 

Different format are possible: html, pdf, word, powerpoint ...

The way to format text in a notebook to render it nicely uses a style called Markdown

`r faa("exclamation-triangle", animate="flash", speed="slow", color="red")` **Warning**: you cannot share a notebook files with the format .ipynb, .Rmd, or .qmd, they are only for your own use or a team work.

## Your turn!

1/ Go to https://colab.google/ and create a **New Notebook**

2/ Create a Text chunk/cell which includes:
  - a H1 title level with #
  - a text with word in bold and italic using `**` or `*`
  - any image from internet with `![](url.image)`
  
3/ Create a code chunk/cell with the following code:
```
import plotly.express as px
fig = px.scatter(x=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], y=[0, 1, 4, 9, 16])

# Render a Notebook to html in Colab

There is no native solution to render a Notebook to html in Colab, you need to use code.

Once again, the internet is great and two videos with the same solution are short and well explained:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jplf4-ubt4
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPGAGg3c8SE

Here are the steps:

1/ `File` > `Download` > `Download .ipynb`

2/ In the Files menu, upload the .ipynb file you just have downloaded

3/ Create a code chunk/cell with the following code:

```
! jupyter nbconvert --to html notebook_name.ipynb
```

4/ Refresh the list of files and eventually download the .html file created

# Render a Notebook to html in Jupyter

Jupyter is much more easier, just use `File` > `Download as` > `HTML (.html)`

And this is it!

---

# What is GitHub

Primary used to collaborate on code development, it became multi-purpose:

- Version Control
- File and Code Storage
- Collaboration
- Developers Social Media
- Online Publication & Website Host
- Automatic Actions

And even more that I am not aware of!

# How does GitHub Work?

The core principle of GitHub is a remote desktop (or profile) with a folder called **Repository** for each project you are working on or you worked on (also called "Repo" if you want to use the slang).

```{r}
include_img("github_dd_profile.png")
```

# GitHub Commit

---

# Always Commit Changes

In GitHub, a commit is a saved change to a project's source code or other files. When you make changes to a file in a GitHub repository, you create a new version of that file. **Once you're ready to save those changes, you create a commit**.

**A commit contains a snapshot of the changes** you've made to one or more files, along with a message that describes the changes. This **message should be descriptive and clear**, so that other developers can understand what changes you've made and why.

Committing your changes to GitHub is an important part of collaborating with others on a project, as it allows other developers to **see what changes you've made** and merge them into the main project. Commits also make it easy to revert changes if necessary, since you can always go back to a previous commit in the project's history.

> Everytime you want to take into account a change in your repository, you need to commit these changes

---

## Exercise

When you created your new repository, you initialized it with a README file. README files are a great place to describe your project in more detail, or add some documentation such as how to install or use your project. The contents of your README file are automatically shown on the front page of your repository.

**Follow the steps here after to commit a change to the README file.**

---

# Commit the First Change

1/ In your repository's list of files, **click README.md**. 

```{r out.width='50%'}
include_graphics("https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-44661/mw-1000/images/help/repository/create-commit-open-readme.webp")
```

---

# Commit the First Change

2/ In the upper right corner of the file view, **click the pen icon to open the file editor**.

```{r out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-90977/mw-1000/images/help/repository/edit-file-edit-button.webp")
```

3/ In the text box, **type some information about the project**.

4/ Above the new content, click **Preview**.

```{r out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-66827/mw-1000/images/help/repository/edit-readme-preview-changes.webp")
```

---

# Commit the First Change

.pull-left[
5/ **Review the changes** you made to the file. You will see the new content in green.

6/ Click **Commit changes...**

7/ In the "Commit message" field, type a short, meaningful **commit message** that describes the change you made to the file. 
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
include_graphics("https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-33561/mw-1000/images/help/repository/create-commit-review.webp")
```
]

8/ Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. Select **commit directly to the `main` branch** for now. 

`r faa("exclamation-triangle", animate="flash", speed="slow", color="red")` Warning: For collaborative projects never commit to the main branch

9/ Click **Propose file change**.

# GitHub Pages

# GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a **web hosting service** offered by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. This means you can use GitHub to store and version control your website's code, and then host it for free using GitHub Pages.

GitHub Pages supports several **different types of websites, including personal or project pages**, documentation, blogs, and more. You can use custom domains or subdomains for your website, and GitHub Pages also supports HTTPS encryption for secure communication.

To create a GitHub Pages website, you need to have a GitHub account and a r**epository containing your website's HTML, CSS, and other files**. Once you've created your repository and pushed your website's files to it, you can e**nable GitHub Pages in the repository settings**. Your website will then be published at a URL based on your GitHub username and repository name (e.g., username.github.io/repository).
